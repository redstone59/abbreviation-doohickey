Python program that allows for keyboard abbreviations from a `.json` file.
Originally designed for use in LaTeX note taking (minimising hand reaching and shift and arrow pressing), but can be used for other purposes.

# Example
With the default LaTeX abbreviations, one could type the quadratic formula like this:

Original LaTeX: `x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}`

Abbreviated version (arrows in square brackets): `x=fr -b+-sqrt bex 2[right]-4ac[right][right][right]2a`
